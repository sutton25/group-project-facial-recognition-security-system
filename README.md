This project combines Arduino, Python, and Teachable Machine to create a facial recognition security system. If a recognized face is detected, a green light turns on. If not, a password must be entered — or a buzzer will sound on failure.

📦 Features

✅ Face detection using Teachable Machine (TensorFlow/Keras).

🟢 Green LED for recognized faces.

🔐 Keypad for password entry if face is not recognized.

🚨 Buzzer/Red LED on wrong password.

🔄 Arduino ↔ Python serial communication.

🧠 AI Model
